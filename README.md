This is a project for the Odin Project curriculum.

A simple five rounds game of rock, paper, scissors against a computer. you will have to enter rock, paper, or scissors when prompted, don't worry it is case insesitive. If prompted to enter another value right after entering you choice make sure that there are no typos.

After each round, you will be informed whether you lost that round or won it, and what the computer picked.

At the end of the five rounds, you will be declared either a winner, or a loser, or you will be told that you tied.

Enjoy !
